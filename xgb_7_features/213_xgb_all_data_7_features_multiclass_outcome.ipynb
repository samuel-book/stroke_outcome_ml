    "Analyse the impact of 14 scenarios for deciding who gets treatment. How does this difference in decision making affect patient outcomes? Here we also explore different ways of defining the 'best outcome'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 14 scenarios (different ways of selecting which patient to give treatment to):\n",
    "1. All patients are treated\n",
    "1. No patients are treated\n",
    "1. Actual treatment decision\n",
    "1. High-benchmark treatment decision (25 hospitals with highest SHAP hospital value)\n",
    "1. Low-benchmark treatment decision (25 hospitals with lowest SHAP hospital value)\n",

    "Model: XGBoost classifier [from notebook 200]\\\n",

    "Kfold split: First kfold split\n",

    "Model: XGBoost classifier (multiclass classification) [from notebook 040]\\\n",

    "Kfold split: First kfold split\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the model to predict each patients mRS probability distributions with/without thrombolysis (individual mRS probability, cumulative probability distributions, and weighted mRS). The scenario will determine whether the patient gets treatment. For those patients that did not get thrombolysis in the observed dataset, assume their scan-to-treatment is the median of the hospital attended.\n",
